# Navigational patterns

This section is dedicated to explore one of the most useful navigational object-oriented patterns and clearify how to apply them in the Angular way.

Navigational patterns are essentially implemented under the purpose of organizing events that related to the navigation of the users of the application.

Angular by default forces you to to do the most of your work in a certain way, which is the object-oriented approach. This means by using all the previous mentioned parts (components, services, pipes, etc...).

By forcing the developer to implement these building blocks upon the building of the application ensure a good architecture. This is too close to the way other famous framework approach like the Zend framework for PHP, or Ruby on Rails for Ruby.

Framework that forces a certain way of building application are here to make the life of the developer easier and boost the speed of the development phase.

Let's be honest, Angular way of designing things is way above average. This can be both a negative and a positive point depending on the side you take.

During this section, we will expore the following patterns:

- Model-view-controller
- Redux

## MVC

The whole principle behind the famous model-view-controller design pattern is relatively simple.

As showing in the diagram below, the MVC design pattern is composed of three blocks: Model, View, and Controller:
