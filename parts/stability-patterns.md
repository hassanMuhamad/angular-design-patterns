Here, we put the light on one of the cornerstones of software engineering. The only rule here, is that you must expect the worst from your environment and your users and be prepared for it.

In this chapter, we will cover about stability patterns and anti-patterns, such as the following list:

- Timeouts
- Circuit breaker
- Factory
- Memento
- The prototype and reusable pool
